## Kitchen project

### Before drywall

* 
[ ] Patric plans to fill floor gaps around bathroom

### Electrical needs

* Fusebox has been replaced
* Outlet for hot water heater has been installed
* Basement stairs switch has been fixed
* Changed upstairs bedroom outlets to grounded (front of house)
 
 [ ] Outlet under circuit box does not work, used for washing machine

### Plumbing

### Misc

[ ] Want details on the pantry doors, now that we cannot have the 24" doors originally planned

[ ] I need the change orders for the exhaust vent removal and fusebox replacement to sign

[ ] Need repairs on two front windows


### Things I don't love

* The new wall at base of stairs going up.  Seems to me this could be cleaner
* The framing to support drywall in the peak, especially the bottom right and bottom left corners.
